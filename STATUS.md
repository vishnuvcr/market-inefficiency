## Overall phase

**Phase 4 — Preregistered option-market hypothesis testing**

Status: **PHASE 4A — NIFTY OPTIDX DATA ACQUISITION / VALIDATION IN PROGRESS**

Phase 3 real-data discovery is complete as a descriptive layer. Phase 4 is now building the point-in-time option dataset required for falsifiable VRP, jump-risk and surface-shape tests.

## Phase tracker

| Phase | Status | Completion | Current gate |
|---|---|---:|---|
| 0. Governance & infrastructure | 🟢 Complete | 100% | Protocol and CI scaffolding |
| 1. Literature/source validation | 🟢 Complete | 100% | Exit gate passed |
| 2. Data engineering | 🟢 Core snapshot validated | 85% | Derivatives source acceptance |
| 3. Stylized facts/discovery | 🟢 Real-data discovery complete | 100% | Findings frozen as descriptive evidence |
| 4. Option-market hypotheses | 🟡 In progress | 15% | NIFTY OPTIDX EOD snapshot |
| 5. Multimodal regime model | ⚪ Not started | 0% | Leakage-safe option/underlying regime dataset |
| 6. Portfolio/execution | ⚪ Not started | 0% | Net-of-cost simulator |
| 7. Statistical validation | ⚪ Not started | 0% | CPCV + DSR + PBO |
| 8. Paper trading | ⚪ Not started | 0% | Post-validation only |
| 9. Ongoing governance | ⚪ Not started | 0% | Drift/revalidation automation |

## Validated Phase 3 snapshot

The Kaggle snapshot is immutable and hashed. The clean NIFTY baseline contains **2,799 daily bars / 2,798 return observations**, ending 2026-05-14 after excluding the incomplete 2026-05-15 session.

Phase 3 findings remain diagnostic only. None is treated as proof of exploitable inefficiency.

## Phase 4 preregistration

`docs/PHASE4_PREREGISTRATION.md` freezes the initial candidate hypotheses:
- H-A1 aggregate variance-risk premium;
- H-A2 state dependence of VRP;
- H-B1 jump-risk premium;
- H-C1 surface-shape predictability;
- H-D1 regime-conditioned efficiency.

The formal lifecycle remains:

**hypothesis → PIT data snapshot → feature construction → baseline → formal test → leakage audit → cost model → CPCV → DSR/PBO → stress tests → untouched holdout → decision**

## Phase 4A — NSE option EOD data gate

The NSE runner has validated access to both the public historical contract-wise interface and the daily UDiFF archive route. A 2026-05-14 UDiFF archive returned HTTP 200 and contained 1,950 NIFTY option rows in the probe.

The fixed-contract probe returned zero rows for its particular test parameters. This is treated only as a contract-query result, not as evidence that NIFTY option data is unavailable. The daily archive is therefore the primary acquisition route.

Implemented:
- `scripts/probe_nse_fno_historical.py`
- `scripts/probe_nse_option_surface.py`
- `scripts/probe_nse_udiff_bhavcopy.py`
- `scripts/probe_nse_archive_boundary.py`
- `scripts/acquire_nse_nifty_optidx.py`
- `.github/workflows/acquire-nifty-optidx.yml`

The acquisition layer preserves original ZIP files, validates schemas, extracts NIFTY CE/PE rows, normalizes common fields, records SHA-256 hashes and creates an immutable snapshot manifest. Legacy and UDiFF formats are explicitly handled separately rather than silently assumed identical.

The first bounded pilot is **2026-05-01 through 2026-05-14** and is currently running in GitHub Actions.

## Immediate next gates

1. Complete the NIFTY OPTIDX pilot.
2. Validate the legacy/UDiFF historical boundary.
3. Measure daily coverage and NIFTY option-contract counts.
4. Freeze the normalized option-EOD schema and snapshot.
5. Add point-in-time lot-size and risk-free inputs.
6. Begin Phase 4B implied-volatility/surface reconstruction.
